Weekly notes about what I'm working on
======================================

Started writing tests for noise transport and things started to get more real, for instance:
after reversing the too-many-sockets issue I realized I had left myself without a way to configure the actual underlying socket
like I couldn't tell it a port to use so it would pick a random one every time and so I'd have to get the port from the socket structure itself
then I got pulled back over to Easy-Install for a few days with the updates url in router.config bug, then the gitlab email issue, didn't get much further than that
thulium's willingness to second-guess my refactoring decisions continues to be valuable, he's finding things to simplify about twice a week days and running them by me, looking forward to seeing what comes of that
we're both working on branches right now with merges planned for "Soon"
